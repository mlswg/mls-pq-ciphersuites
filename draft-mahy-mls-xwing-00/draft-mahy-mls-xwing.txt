1.  Introduction

   The potential availability of a cryptographically-relevant quantum
   computer has caused concern that well-funded adversaries could
   overturn long-held assumptions about the security assurances of
   classical Key Exchange Mechanisms (KEMs) and classical cryptographic
   signatures, which are fundamental to modern security protocols,
   including the MLS protocol [RFC9420].

   The MLS Working Group has expressed strong desire to have a handful
   of complimentary post-quantum security extensions for use with the
   MLS protocol to address the related threats:

   1.  A straightforward MLS cipher suite that replaces a classical KEM
       with a hybrid post-quantum/traditional KEM.  Such a cipher suite
       could be implemented as a drop-in replacement in many MLS
       libraries without changes to any other part of the MLS stack.
       The aim is for implementations to have a single KEM which would
       be performant and work for the vast majority of implementations.
       It addresses the the harvest-now / decrypt-later threat model
       using the simplest, and most practicable solution available.

   2.  Versions of existing cipher suites that use post-quantum
       signatures; and specific guidelines on the construction, use, and
       validation of hybrid signatures.

   3.  One or more mechanisms which reduce the bandwidth or storage
       requirements, or improve performance when using post-quantum
       algorithms (for example by updating post-quantum keys less
       frequently than classical keys, or by sharing portions of post-
       quantum keys across a large number of clients or groups.)

   This document addresses the first of these work items.  It reserves
   an MLS cipher suite value based on the MLS default cipher suite, but
   replacing the KEM with the X-Wing [I-D.connolly-cfrg-xwing-kem]
   hybrid post-quantum / traditional KEM.  The IANA Hybrid Public Key
   Encryption (HPKE) [RFC9180] Key Exchange Mechanism (KEM) Identifier
   value for X-Wing is pending at the time of this writing.

   X-Wing is a "concrete, simple choice for [a] post-quantum hybrid KEM,
   that should be suitable for the vast majority of use cases".  X-Wing
   combines the ML-KEM [MLKEM] post-quantum KEM and the X25519 [RFC7748]
   traditional KEM.  The MLS cipher suite uses the other components of
   the default MLS cipher suite
   MLS_128_DHKEMX25519_AES128GCM_SHA256_Ed25519.

   This document replaces a previous, similar proposal based on the KEM
   in [I-D.draft-westerbaan-cfrg-hpke-xyber768d00].

2.  Security Considerations

   This ciphersuite uses a hybrid post-quantum/traditional KEM and a
   traditional signature algorithm.  As such, it is designed to provide
   confidentiality against quantum and classical attacks, but provides
   authenticity against classical attacks only.  This is actually very
   useful, because an attacker could store MLS-encrypted traffic that
   uses any classical KEM today.  If years or decades in the future a
   quantum attack on classical KEMs becomes feasible, the traffic sent
   today (some of which could still be sensitive in the future) will
   then be readable.  By contrast, an attack on a signature algorithm in
   MLS would require an active attack which can extract the private key
   during the signature key's lifetime.

   The security properties of [I-D.connolly-cfrg-xwing-kem] apply.

3.  IANA Considerations
