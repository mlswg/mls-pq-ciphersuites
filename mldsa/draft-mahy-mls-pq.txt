      ML-KEM and Hybrid Cipher Suites for Messaging Layer Security
                        draft-mahy-mls-pq-latest

Abstract

   This document registers new cipher suites for Messaging Layer
   Security (MLS) based on "post-quantum" algorithms, which are intended
   to be resilient to attack by quantum computers.  These cipher suites
   are constructed using the new Module-Lattice Key Encapsulation
   Mechanism (ML-KEM), optionally in combination with traditional
   elliptic curve KEMs, together with appropriate authenticated
   encryption, hash, and signature algorithms.

1.  Introduction

   The potential availability of a cryptographically-relevant quantum
   computer has caused concern that well-funded adversaries could
   overturn long-held assumptions about the security assurances of
   classical Key Exchange Mechanisms (KEMs) and classical cryptographic
   signatures, which are fundamental to modern security protocols,
   including the MLS protocol [RFC9420].

   Of particular concern are "harvest now, decrypt later" attacks, by
   which an attacker could collect encrypted traffic now, before a
   quantum computer exists, and later use a quantum computer to break
   the confidentiality protections on the collected traffic.

   In response to these concerns, the cryptographic community has
   defined "post-quantum" algorithms, which are designed to be resilient
   to attacks by quantum computers.  Symmetric algorithms can be made
   post-quantum secure simply by using longer keys and hashes.  For
   asymmetric operations such as KEMs and signatures, entirely new
   algorithms are needed.

   In this document, we define ciphersuites that use the post-quantum
   secure Module-Lattice-Based KEM (ML-KEM) [MLKEM] together with
   appropriate symmetric algorithms and either traditional or post-
   quantum signature algorithms.  These traditional signature cipher
   suites address the risk of "harvest now, decrypt later" attacks,
   while not taking on the additional cost of post-quantum signatures.
   The cipher suites with post-quantum signatures use only post-quantum
   KEMs.

   Following the pattern of base MLS, we define several variations, to
   allow for users that prefer to only use NIST-approved cryptography,
   users that prefer a higher security level, and users that prefer a
   PQ/traditional hybrid KEM over pure ML-KEM:

   *  ML-KEM-768 + X25519 (Medium security, Non-NIST, PQ/T hybrid)

   *  ML-KEM-768 + P-256 (Medium security, NIST, PQ/T hybrid)

   *  ML-KEM-1024 + P-384 (High security, NIST, PQ/T hybrid)

   *  ML-KEM-768 (Medium security, NIST, pure PQ KEM)

   *  ML-KEM-1024 (High security, NIST, pure PQ KEM)

   *  ML-KEM-768 (Medium security, NIST, pure PQ)

   *  ML-KEM-1024 (High security, NIST, pure PQ)

   For all the cipher suites defined in this document, we use AES256 GCM
   [GCM] as the Authenticated Encryption with Authenticated Data (AEAD)
   [RFC5116] algorithm; HMAC [RFC2104] with SHA-384 [SHS] as the hash
   function; and XOF(SHAKE256) (Section 3.2 of [FIPS202]) as the Key
   Derivation Function (KDF).

   For the PQ/T hybrid KEMs and the pure ML-KEM HPKE integration, we use
   the KEMs defined in [I-D.ietf-hpke-pq].  The signature scheme for ML-
   DSA-87 [MLDSA] is defined in [I-D.ietf-tls-mldsa].

2.  IANA Considerations

2.1.  MLS Cipher Suites

   This document requests that IANA add the following entries to the
   "MLS Cipher Suites" registry, replacing "XXXX" with the RFC number
   assigned to this document:

   The mapping of cipher suites to HPKE primitives [I-D.ietf-hpke-hpke],
   HMAC hash functions, and TLS signature schemes [RFC8446] is as
   follows:

    +======+======+========+========+========+========================+

                                  Table 2

   The hash used for the MLS transcript hash is the one referenced in
   the cipher suite name.  "SHA384" refers to the SHA-384 functions
   defined in [SHS].

3.  Security Considerations

   This ciphersuites defined in this document combine a post-quantum (or
   PQ/T hybrid) KEM with a traditional signature algorithm.  As such,
   they are designed to provide confidentiality against quantum and
   classical attacks, but provide authenticity against classical attacks
   only.  Thus, these cipher suites do not provide full post-quantum
   security, only post-quantum confidentiality.  Cipher suites using
   post-quantum secure signature algorithms may be defined in the
   future.

   For security considerations related to the KEMs used in this
   document, please see the documents that define those KEMs
   [I-D.ietf-hpke-pq] and [I-D.irtf-cfrg-hybrid-kems].

   For security considerations related to the post-quantum signature
   algorithms used in this document, please see [I-D.ietf-tls-mldsa] and
   [I-D.ietf-lamps-dilithium-certificates].
